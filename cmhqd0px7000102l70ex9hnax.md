# 🎥 Download Wistia Videos via Browser Network Requests (HLS Playlist Guide)

When Wistia hosts a video, it’s not a single `.mp4` file — it’s delivered through **HLS streaming**. That means the video is broken into many small `.ts` chunks, described by a playlist (`.m3u8`). If you want to save the whole video, you need the **playlist URL**.

The easiest and most reliable way to find it is through your browser’s **Network tab**.

Actually its by getting the [Wistia Video Downloader](https://serp.ly/wistia-video-downloader) 👈 👈 👈 👈

---

## 🔎 Step 1: Open the Network Tab

1. Open the page that has the Wistia video.
2. Right-click → **Inspect** (or press <kbd>F12</kbd>).
3. Go to the **Network** tab.
4. Play the video for a few seconds so requests appear.

---

## 🔎 Step 2: Filter for `.m3u8`

In the filter box at the top of the Network tab, type:

```
m3u8
```

You’ll usually see two kinds of URLs appear:

* ✅ `https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/<id>.m3u8` → **Master playlist** (contains all quality levels).
* ⚠️ `https://embed-cloudfront.wistia.com/deliveries/...m3u8` → **Delivery playlist** (just one quality).

👉 Always prefer the `fast.wistia.com` link — it gives you the option to choose the best quality automatically.

---

## 🔎 Step 3: Copy the Playlist URL

1. Right-click on the `fast.wistia.com` request.
2. **Copy → Copy link address.**
3. Save it somewhere — this is the key to downloading.

---

## 💻 Step 4: Download with yt-dlp

If you want the **best quality automatically**:

```bash
yt-dlp -f best --no-playlist \
  "https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/9xkvdkwqa8.m3u8"
```

---

## 💻 Step 5: Download with ffmpeg

If you prefer direct ffmpeg:

```bash
ffmpeg -i "https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/9xkvdkwqa8.m3u8" \
  -c copy output.mp4
```

* `-c copy` = don’t re-encode, just join the stream into a clean `.mp4`.

---

## ⚡ Pro Tips

* **Headers**: Some videos require a `Referer`. Copy it from the request in the Network tab:

  ```bash
  yt-dlp --add-header "Referer: https://the.page.url/" "<m3u8-url>"
  ```
* **Multiple videos**: Use `--no-playlist` so yt-dlp doesn’t try to fetch everything on the page.
* **Single quality**: If you only see a CloudFront `deliveries/...m3u8`, you can still download it — you just won’t get higher resolutions.
* **Cookies**: Rarely, Wistia videos require authentication. If you see cookies in the Network request, export them with your browser (or use `--cookies-from-browser`).


### Reliable, fast and go-to

```
yt-dlp -f best \
  --no-playlist \
  --concurrent-fragments 16 \
  --remux-video mp4 \
  --postprocessor-args "ffmpeg:-movflags +faststart" \
  --add-header "Referer:https://PAGE-YOU-GOT-THE-WISTIA-URL-FROM/" \
  "https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/9xkvdkwqa8.m3u8"
```

---

## ✅ Summary

* Always start in the **Network tab** → filter `m3u8`.
* Prefer `fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/<id>.m3u8` over CloudFront deliveries.
* Use yt-dlp (`best`) or ffmpeg (`-c copy`) to download.
* Add headers/cookies if needed.
